        <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer broad of directors. Our mission is to bring
        nationally and internationally renowed, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and 
        entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:</p>
            <blockquote>"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge... and that is priceless"</blockquote>
